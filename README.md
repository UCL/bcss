# Sample size for cluster randomised trials with baseline data

This repository contains software to support the paper "Cluster randomised trials with baseline data: sample size and optimal designs" by Andrew Copas and Richard Hooper (under review). 

The paper shows how to choose the extent of baseline data collection (as a proportion of the whole) under retrospective and prospective data collection.

The software provides interactive plots of relative efficiency against the extent of baseline data collection. The user may vary the sample size, cluster autocorrelation and intra-cluster correlation.

The software is provided in 
1. Stata, as program bcss (see folder "bcss")
2. an R Shiny app available at 
[Interactive charts at shinyapps](https://kmcgrath.shinyapps.io/Rprograms) (with source code in folder "R programs")
